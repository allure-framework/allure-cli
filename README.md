# Allure Command Line Tool
**Allure CLI** allows you to generate Allure report [from existing XML files](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-core/wiki#gathering-information-about-tests) with no need to install any CI system or sophisticated build tool. To generate report with this tool you only need to have XML files generated by adapter.

## Usage
### Generating report
To generate report simply run the following command:
```bash
$ allure generate path/to/directory/with/xml/files
```
or 
```bash
$ allure report generate path/to/directory/with/xml/files
```
By default report is generated to directory named **allure-report**. When done simply open **index.html** page from the output directory or type:
```bash
$ allure report open
```
To clean report direcotory use the following command: 
```bash
$ allure report clean
```
In order to change output directory type:
```bash
$ allure generate path/to/directory/with/xml/files -o path/to/output/directory
```
### Selecting Report Version
Starting from CLI 2.0 you can specify version of the report to be used using **-v** flag:
```bash
$ allure generate path/to/directory/with/xml/files -v 1.3.6
$ allure generate path/to/directory/with/xml/files -v 1.4.0
```
This allows you to use the same CLI with less or more outdated adapters. Default version is **1.3.9**. All required files are downloaded from Internet automatically (this fact is important if you try to use CLI in offline environment).
### Getting help
To show help type:
